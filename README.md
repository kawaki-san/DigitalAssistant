# Kayla

Kayla is a JavaFX digital assistant powered by Amazon Lex. We'll use Java modules to give her functionality of different tasks. We'll then deploy these to AWS Lambda which has a connection to our bot and we can then call and execute these functions through Kayla.


## Contributing
She's opensource so if you have time to contribute, feel free to. The more modules and functionality we can add on to her, the better. 

## Project Status
Ongoing. I'll work on this as often as I can. Progress can be a little slow since I'm also juggling work on the side.
